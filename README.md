# nixos-config
just my standard NixOS configuration using flakes and home-manager, how original. NixOS modules go in the `mod` directory, home-manager modules go in the `mod-hm` directory. configurations are defined in `flake.nix` and importing `default.nix` from either `mod` or `mod-hm` will import all modules from that directory. by default, setup.nix creates a flame user and imports all home-manager modules by default. machine configurations are in `host/${hostname}`, and flame.setup.enable will generally be the first option necessary to make a machine do what i want. i have not yet set up a fancy way of deploying these configurations, but i plan to.
